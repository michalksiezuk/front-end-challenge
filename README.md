# Front End Challenge
Welcome to our challenge for the Front End Developer position.

The challenge is super simple but would help us to understand the way you work.

At Super we believe in as humans we have different opinions and ways to tackle down problems. So on this challenge doesn’t exist a “correct” answer.

## Instructions:
- Read the task to do.
- Explore the Figma File to inspect the design or just see the example image on /assets folder.
- Once you have the design ready please make a PR with the solution.


## The Job
Take a design made by our lead designer and try to translate it into a functional version with HTML, CSS or/and JS.

## Considerations/Requirements:

- The page needs to follow a mobile-first approach.
- When the user taps/clicks a payment frequency option label/name this needs to be selected. (Not only if I click the radio input)
- You can use whatever CSS/HTML Architecture or Framework.
- Use any sans-serif font.

## Extra Points:
- If you use Tailwind CSS.
- If you made a Desktop version.
